Location based services platform (geo2tag) This is a LBS solution for integrating all location based functionality


Today there are more and more mobile devices equipped with GPS module on the market. And it is not only about GPS navigators — big part of mobile phones also have this functionality. But they have not other usage except navigation.

At the same time social networks become a dominant part of internet services. They count millions of users and they increase number of features all the time - from simple text messaging to user`s media content storage.

Our project is an attempt to use Location technologies for something other than navigation. We decided to combine it`s capabilities with social network`s features in our project — Geo2tag. It will give user an opportunity not only for information sharing but also for showing it on map, for example shows where were created user`s photos, videos or notes. The ultimate goal is to create Open Source Location Platform for global geo tagging.
