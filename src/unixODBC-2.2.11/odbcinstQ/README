Description:

	This is the Qt plugin for odbcinst.
	
Problem:
      
        The ODBC sub-system, as specified by Microsoft, needs
	to interact with the User on occasion. For example; to 
	admin the data sources or drivers. Unfortunately for
	unixODBC; it can not commit itself to a specific method
	to interact with the User. unixODBC must account for a 
	wide variety of methods - any of which the User may be using.
	For example; console, native X, Qt, KDE, GTK, none, etc
	
Solution:

        One possible solution is to conditionaly compile support
	into the sub-system. But there are two important draw-backs
	to this; 1) the entire system (and all Users) would only be
	able to use one method to interact with the sub-system and 
	2) changing the interaction method would require a recompile.
	A better solution, and the one used here, is to use a plugin
	system.
	
        This library is a plugin. The plugin 'manager' is the standard
	odbcinst library.
	
Notes:

        This library is ONLY used by the odbcinst library. For
	example; the ODBCConfig tool calls SQLManageDataSources()
	in the odbcinst library and odbcinst will pass the call to
	a library (such as this one) to resolve the request. This
	allows all of the User interaction bits to be a plugin and
	transparent to the caller. Do not use this library directly.

WARNING: 

	If an application calls SQLManageDataSources() for Qt then
	it must be using the same Qt library with which odbcinstQ
	was built. Also; do not mix threaded and non-threaded versions
	of the library. If this sounds scary then consider having
	your application try to execute the ODBCConfig program rather
	than call SQLManageDataSources().
