INSTALL
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:

	Qt v3 must be installed on your system. Older versions
	may work also.	
	
What To Do:

        This will get built and installed along with the rest
        of unixODBC. 

        However; you can do this manually after core unixODBC
        stuff is installed. Here are the steps to do it. 
	
	Step 1
	
	# qmake qmake.pro
	
	This uses the Qt qmake utility to build a Makefile for
	your platform. It is easier than the GNU stuff and should
	work for any machine with Qt on it. You may have to 
	comment/uncomment some lines for the Mac OSX so Mac OSX
	users should take a look in qmake.pro.

	Step 2
	
	# make

	This is the usual make step. This will generate a 
	set of libs called libodbcinstQ.*
	
	Step 3
	
	# cp lib* /usr/local/lib
	
	Basically you want to put the lib somewhere. You MUST
	put it where your libodbcinst.so is.
